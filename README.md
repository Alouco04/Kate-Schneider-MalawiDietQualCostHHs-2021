# Kate Schneider PhD Thesis Replication Files
 Replication files for Kate Schneider's 2021 Dissertation Thesis

These files create the datasets that can be used to replicate the results in this thesis.

The files are numbered in the order they run, some are contingent on output datasets created in earlier files. 

The article on diet quality uses the ideal shared nutrient requirements where all household members age 3 and above can define the household shared requirement. 

The articles that include least-cost diets use a revised version of nutrient requirements. The code to create these files is in the do files indicated with "r", which stands for revised shared nutrient requirements method. The files indicated with "scenarios" replicate the data modifications used to calculate least cost diets under various policy scenarios in the third article of the thesis.

All input datasets are included here with the exception of the Malawi Integrated Household Survey Panel data which can be downloaded from the World Bank webite at: https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/malawi-integrated-household-panel-survey-2010-2013-2016-2019-long-term-panel-102-eas

This thesis uses only the 2010, 2013, and 2016 rounds of panel data as the 2019 data were not released until the end of 2020.
